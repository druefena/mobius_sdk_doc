Empower your product with our pre-trained models.
Our technology is engineered to work on Android smart phones.
We believe that privacy matters even in the 21st century, and therefore all
processing happens on the device locally, and not a cloud.


We currently offer four modules:

* Keywording module: Tag images with more than 5000 general keywords
* Aesthetics module: Estimate image aesthetics (based on professional curators' style)
* Search module: Return similar images given query image or keywords
* Customisation module: Add custom keywords and/or style
